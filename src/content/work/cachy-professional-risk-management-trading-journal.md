## **Cachy – Professional Risk Management & Trading Journal**

**The Local-First Solution for Privacy-Conscious Crypto Traders.**

**Cachy is a high-performance trading companion designed to bridge the gap between professional trading terminals and user-friendly portfolio trackers. At its core, Cachy is built on the philosophy that successful trading doesn't start with order execution, but with consistent capital preservation.**

## 🛡️ The Philosophy: Money First, Privacy Always

While traditional platforms store sensitive data like API keys and trade histories on central servers, Cachy utilizes a radical **Local-First architecture**.

* **Absolute Data Sovereignty**: All settings, API keys, and journal entries remain exclusively in your browser's local storage (`localStorage`). There is no central database and no registration required.
* **Risk-Centric Trading**: Cachy works "backwards." Instead of asking "how much do I want to buy?", you define your risk amount in dollars. The system then mathematically calculates the optimal position size based on your stop-loss.

## ✨ Core Features at a Glance

### 🔢 Smart Trading Calculator

* **Precision to the Cent**: By integrating `Decimal.js`, Cachy avoids floating-point errors to ensure financial calculations are performed with absolute accuracy.
* **Dynamic Stop-Loss**: Use the integrated ATR (Average True Range) calculation to automatically adjust your stop-loss based on current market volatility.
* **Multi-Target Take Profit**: Plan partial exits for up to 5 targets with automatic rebalancing and detailed Risk/Reward (R/R) analysis.

### 📊 Real-Time Market Data & Technicals

* **Live Feeds**: Thanks to WebSocket integration, you receive real-time prices and market data directly from exchanges like Bitunix and Binance.
* **Technicals Panel**: A dedicated overlay for oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic) and mathematically calculated Pivot Points for rapid market assessment.

### 📓 Deep-Dive Trading Journal

Cachy is more than just a logbook; it is an analysis engine for your trading behavior:

* **Professional Metrics**: Track key performance indicators such as the **Profit Factor**, **SQN** (System Quality Number), and **MAE/MFE** to measure your exit efficiency.
* **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify "profit leaks" through time-based analysis (days of the week/hours) or recognize psychological patterns like "tilt" after losing streaks.
* **Strategy Attribution**: Tag your trades (e.g., "Breakout" or "FOMO") to discover which setups statistically provide the highest returns for you.

## 🛠️ Modern Tech Stack

Cachy is optimized for "speed of thought":

* **SvelteKit & TypeScript**: For a reactive, lightning-fast user interface without latency.
* **TailwindCSS**: A highly customizable UI featuring over 20 different themes.
* **Jules API**: An AI-powered diagnostic layer for intelligent, real-time error analysis.

### Why Cachy?

In a world of data breaches and opaque fee structures, Cachy provides traders with a tool that combines **Capital Preservation ("Money First")**, **User Experience ("User First")**, and **Data Privacy ("Community First")**.
