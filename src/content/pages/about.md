journeyTitle: "From Vision to <span class='text-accent'>Strategic Implementation</span>"
journeyText: "This conviction is the result of a long journey. It began with my training as a Management Assistant in IT-Systems (2000-2004), which laid my commercial and strategic foundation. The creative spark followed in 2009, when I developed my first 3D educational game with Blender during my European Voluntary Service—years before the Metaverse became a trend. After completing further studies in Computer Science (2011-2012), becoming a certified Online Marketing Manager (2018), and gaining years of experience implementing digital projects (including WordPress), I realized: Classic web design is no longer enough. The true fascination lies in interactivity."
quote: "<span class='font-black'>\"The decisive turning point came in 2022</span> when I partnered with a team of expert Unity developers. **Together, we build** revolutionary platforms and interactive experiences. This unique journey from merchant to marketer to XR specialist is your greatest advantage today: <span class='text-accent font-bold'>I am not just a developer, but your strategic partner</span> who understands your vision and translates it into measurable success. <strong>Our Vision:</strong> The Metaverse is not a single app. It is a network of millions of virtual worlds and digital experiences that people visit to play, socialize and collaborate. Today, most of these experiences are closed and disconnected walled gardens.\""
