# Cachy
## <strong>Cachy – Professional Risk Management & Trading Journal</strong><p><strong>The Local-First Solution for Privacy-Conscious Crypto Traders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cachy is a high-performance trading companion designed to bridge the gap between professional trading terminals and user-friendly portfolio trackers. At its core, Cachy is built on the philosophy that successful trading doesn't start with order execution, but with consistent capital preservation.</strong></p>
## 🛡️ The Philosophy: Money First, Privacy Always
<p>While traditional platforms store sensitive data like API keys and trade histories on central servers, Cachy utilizes a radical <strong>Local-First architecture</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absolute Data Sovereignty</strong>: All settings, API keys, and journal entries remain exclusively in your browser's local storage (<code>localStorage</code>). There is no central database and no registration required.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-Centric Trading</strong>: Cachy works "backwards." Instead of asking "how much do I want to buy?", you define your risk amount in dollars. The system then mathematically calculates the optimal position size based on your stop-loss.</li>
</ul>
## ✨ Core Features at a Glance
### 🔢 Smart Trading Calculator
<ul>
<li><strong>Precision to the Cent</strong>: By integrating <code>Decimal.js</code>, Cachy avoids floating-point errors to ensure financial calculations are performed with absolute accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Stop-Loss</strong>: Use the integrated ATR (Average True Range) calculation to automatically adjust your stop-loss based on current market volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Target Take Profit</strong>: Plan partial exits for up to 5 targets with automatic rebalancing and detailed Risk/Reward (R/R) analysis.</li>
</ul>
### 📊 Real-Time Market Data & Technicals
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Feeds</strong>: Thanks to WebSocket integration, you receive real-time prices and market data directly from exchanges like Bitunix and Binance.</li>
<li><strong>Technicals Panel</strong>: A dedicated overlay for oscillators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic) and mathematically calculated Pivot Points for rapid market assessment.</li>
</ul>
### 📓 Deep-Dive Trading Journal
<p>Cachy is more than just a logbook; it is an analysis engine for your trading behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Professional Metrics</strong>: Track key performance indicators such as the <strong>Profit Factor</strong>, <strong>SQN</strong> (System Quality Number), and <strong>MAE/MFE</strong> to measure your exit efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Analysis</strong>: Identify "profit leaks" through time-based analysis (days of the week/hours) or recognize psychological patterns like "tilt" after losing streaks.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Attribution</strong>: Tag your trades (e.g., "Breakout" or "FOMO") to discover which setups statistically provide the highest returns for you.</li>
</ul>
## 🛠️ Modern Tech Stack
<p>Cachy is optimized for "speed of thought":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SvelteKit & TypeScript</strong>: For a reactive, lightning-fast user interface without latency.</li>
<li><strong>TailwindCSS</strong>: A highly customizable UI featuring over 20 different themes.</li>
