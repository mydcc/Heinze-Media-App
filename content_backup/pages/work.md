**Project Overview**

Development of an interactive Single-Page Application (SPA) as an educational tool for analyzing candlestick chart patterns. The application was intentionally built without external frameworks or libraries, using Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3 to ensure high performance and maintainability.

The project demonstrates the conception and implementation of a complex, data-driven front-end application using only standard web technologies. The focus is on a high-performance, custom canvas visualization and a clean, extensible architecture without the abstraction of external frameworks.

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a fully functional, browser-based chess application suitable for both casual players and ambitious amateurs. The app was designed not only to offer a smooth gaming experience in Player-vs-Player (PvP) and Player-vs-Environment (PvE) modes but also to create genuine added value through the integration of advanced AI functions. The focus was on a clean, intuitive user interface, responsive design, and high performance.

The result is a sophisticated, high-performance, and visually appealing chess application that runs directly in the browser. It demonstrates that complex logic and advanced features can be realized without the use of large frameworks. The well-conceived architecture, with the Web Worker for the AI and seamless API integration, provides a fluid and educational experience that goes far beyond a simple chess simulation.[](https://heinze-media.com/apps/candlesticks_en.html)

Project Overview

**Pat-Man** is a browser-based arcade game developed as a tribute to the timeless classic, Pac-Man. However, the project goes beyond a mere copy, enhancing the original gameplay with a variety of modern features. The goal was to prove that a complex, high-performance, and visually appealing gaming experience with high replayability can be created using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game was developed from scratch, with a focus on procedural level generation, advanced AI behaviors, and a rewarding player progression system.
